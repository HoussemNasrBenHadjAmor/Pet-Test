Firt of all the api is not really a thing! 

To be honest it is the worst api that i ever seen!

To run the project use should run npm i to install the dependencies.

Then run npm start to run the app! 

I did my best to make the app works but the api that you provided me keeps making 
my app bugging.

i did not make the update functionality because the api is bugging.

What i did is getting all the pets data and make a nice design from it ,of course 
you can visit a specific pet detail (but with this api you can not see really details
because it's always bugginnng)

So i worked with React and Tailwind for css design, and for fetching data i 
used Axios.

In the app's folders you'll find a folder named components, this folder contains all
the components that i used like for an example Navbar, Pets, Pet, Pet Detail etc..

And you'll find a lib folder where i fetched the data from the api using axios.

So when you open the app, what really happening is fetching data from api to get all the pets in the database, then i pass the data as props to Pets component. And by mapping on all the data that is passed as props i return a single Pet component containing all the information about a single pet and represent it as nice design.
Of couse on clicking on a single pet you'll be pushed to new page which contains details about a specifi pet.

You'll find on the top a plus Icon which on clicking on it you'll be pushed to create-pet page, and the u can add a new pet to the database.

I really wanted to make update functionality works but unfortunately the api is so bad!
